# Project Status — Career Ops (Will Guo Job Search Pipeline)

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-20
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 — Custom Scripts

## Done
- [x] career-ops cloned at `career-ops/` — on main, clean, npm deps installed
- [x] Knowledge bank ingested (`context/knowledge bank/` — 5 folders, 12+ files)
- [x] Companies source loaded (`context/AI_Companies_Consolidated_Ranked_v2.xlsx` — 450 companies source)
- [x] CLAUDE.md, `.claude/rules/pipeline.md`, `.claude/rules/architecture.md` created
- [x] Project memory bootstrapped
- [x] **Phase 1 complete** — cv.md, config/profile.yml, modes/_profile.md, portals.yml (448 companies: 416 enabled, 32 disabled), data/ initialized (commit 8b847c9)
- [x] Scoring criteria refined — Canadian on-site rules, US remote-only, comp bands (commits d4ecf6f, 5ef75ad)
- [x] `docs/design/pipeline-flow.md` created and committed — 7-section technical reference
- [x] `docs/design/scraping-architecture.md` updated — ATS Discovery Layer section added
- [x] **`custom-scraper.mjs` built** — 3-tier ATS discovery (commit a168147):
  - Tier 1: plain fetch + HTML regex (Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever/Workday patterns)
  - Tier 2: Playwright XHR intercept for JS-rendered ATS widgets
  - Tier 3: generic DOM fallback (cheerio + Playwright)
  - Cache: `data/ats-discovery-cache.json` (30-day TTL, portals.yml never mutated)
  - Tested: Runway dry-run → Tier 2 found Ashby, 4 offers extracted
- [x] `package.json` npm scripts — `custom-scrape`, `full-scan` added; `cheerio` dep added
- [x] portals.yml URL data quality fix — 22 URL corrections + 17 disables (39 total), Runway-adjacent pattern fixed across all groups (commit 3429bfa)
- [x] **portals.yml title_filter expanded** (commit 7cb60ab):
  - Seniority: Staff, Lead, VP/SVP/EVP, Director, Head of, Chief, Managing Director, General Manager
  - Region: 42 keywords (Europe, APAC, LATAM, Middle East) — catches titles with location suffix
  - Language: 16 adjectives (German, French, Spanish, etc.) — covers both "German speaking" and ", German" formats
  - Removed conflicting positives: "Staff AI", "Staff Product Manager", "Group Product Manager"
- [x] **First scan.mjs run** — 1406 jobs tagged as `scan-v1-unfiltered` (commit 06bf430)
  - ⚠️ This data is stale: produced against old portals.yml before URL data quality fix
  - Some company associations may be incorrect (wrong ATS slugs); treat as "before" baseline only
  - Tagged `scan-v1-unfiltered` for diff comparison after clean rescan
- [x] **`export-jobs.mjs` built** — 3-sheet Excel export (commit c6c1fd8):
  - Sheet 1: Pending Jobs, Sheet 2: By Company, Sheet 3: Scan History
  - `exceljs` dep + `npm run export` script added
- [x] `.claude/project-memory.md` created — architecture decisions and known issues

## In Progress / Up Next
- [ ] **Clean rescan** — tag `scan-v1-unfiltered` on commit 06bf430, reset pipeline.md + scan-history.tsv, re-run scan.mjs + custom-scraper.mjs with updated filters
  - scan.mjs: ~13 companies (only those with direct ATS URL in portals.yml)
  - custom-scraper.mjs: 403 companies (branded pages — Tier 1/2 discovers hidden ATS for 100+ of them)
- [ ] Investigate and correct portals.yml entries where `careers_url` points to a generic landing page rather than actual job listings (will show as empty Tier 3 results after scrape)
- [ ] Re-run `export-jobs.mjs` after clean rescan to produce valid Excel

## Blockers
None

## Active Plan
`docs/design/pipeline-flow.md` (section 7 build status) + `docs/design/scraping-architecture.md`

## Handoff Note
Phase 2 scripts all complete. Filters expanded. First scan data is stale (pre-URL-fix portals.yml) — tagged scan-v1-unfiltered. Next step: clean rescan — tag → reset pipeline.md + scan-history.tsv → run scan.mjs → run custom-scraper.mjs (403 branded pages, Tier 1/2 discovers ATS for most) → re-run export-jobs.mjs. Watch for companies returning empty results — likely a landing page URL issue in portals.yml, not a scraper bug.
